## Final Thoughts

Creating this website was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of web development. I gained valuable insights into the complexity of web design and the challenges that come with it. One particular challenge I faced was setting the background image. I struggled for hours trying to position the image correctly behind the main content box on the homepage.

After numerous attempts and breaks, I discovered that the solution was surprisingly simple. By adding a `body` style in the CSS file and specifying the background image within that style, I was able to achieve the desired effect. Hereâ€™s the CSS code that resolved the issue:

```css
body {
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    background-image: url('images/background.jpeg'); /* <-- */
    margin-bottom: 18px;
}
